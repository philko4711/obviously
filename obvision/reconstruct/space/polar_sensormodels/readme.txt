Master Thesis J. Ziegler

These classes turned out to be obsolete. All sensors can be integrated with help of ros 
node polar_sensor_models avail. @github: https://github.com/JuicyJay/polar_sensor_models
and the base class SensorPolar.

I left these files here because of the doxygen documentation that might be helpful for somebody someday
since having no doc is awful and I feel your pain.
